==== 0v9p14 =================================================================

 * Improved support for EFM32WG-DK3850

Known issues;

 * Trace MCU and Trace OUT does not work with this version of the FPGA firmware.
   Using an external trace adapter and Trace IN works.
 * Occasional initialization failure during firmware boot.
   WORKAROUND; Cycle power on the kit by pressing the ON/OFF button.


==== 0v9p12 =================================================================

 * Added support for EFM32WG-DK3850
 * Improvements to the GUI

Added features;

 * Timeout before AEM calibration on VMCU change - allows faster change of VMCU
 * Displaying more information in several GUI screens
 * New font in the GUI

Addressed issues;

 * Debug LED didn't work as expected

Known issues;

 * Trace MCU and Trace OUT does not work with this version of the FPGA firmware.
 * Occasional initialization failure during firmware boot.
   WORKAROUND; Cycle power on the kit by pressing the ON/OFF button.


==== 0v9p10 =================================================================

Added features;

 * Added support for J-Link serial number addressing scheme

Addressed issues;

 * Occasional reliability issues with the board EEPROM.
 * Minor bugfixes and improvements.

Known issues;

 * Trace MCU and Trace OUT does not work with this version of the FPGA firmware.
 * Occasional initialization failure during firmware boot.
   WORKAROUND; Reset kit by pressing the RESET pushbutton.

==== 0v9p8 =================================================================

 * Addded support for DK3550.


==== 0v9p7 =================================================================

Added features;

 * Added support for High-Speed AEM. 6250 Hz current sample rate. Refer to kit user manual for more info.
 * Added feature that allows the user to turn VMCU on/off. Will also turn off debug mode and analog peripheral switches.
 * Added feature that makes energyAware Commander changes to the debug mode persistent.
 * Added on-screen error display for kit failures

Addressed issues;

 * Fixed issue that caused SWO output to fail.
 * Fixed issue that caused kit device erase functionality to frequently fail on Giant and Leopard devices.
 * Improved MCU reset handling under kit boot. MCU reset is now asserted when firmware starts, and released at the end of the firmware boot sequence.
 * Fixed missing MCU reset after on-board flash programming.
 * Fixed issue with on-board debugger when using CrossWorks from Rowley.
 * Only blink binary is now included as on-board binary example

Known issues;

 * Occasional initialization failure during firmware boot. WORKAROUND; Reset kit by pressing the RESET pushbutton.


==== 0v9p5 =================================================================

 * Added support for Leopard Gecko, EFM32LG-DK3650.


==== 0v9p4 =================================================================

 * Initial release
